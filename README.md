# GNC_Autonomous-Landing
This project deals with autonomously guiding an aircraft along a particular glide slope angle as
it approaches the runway for landing. A Boeing 747-100 longitudinal model is considered, and a
controller is designed using the eigen structure assignment method. The model is a two input
(elevator deflection and thrust) model. Simulations are conducted for the case of the aircraft at an
altitude of 2000 ft, a horizontal distance 30,000 ft away from the runway and a horizontal velocity
of 200 ft/s
